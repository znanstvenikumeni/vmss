# vmss

vmss stands for **Video management and streaming services**.

## Who's building vmss?

vmss is being built by the @znanstvenikumeni IT and Data Science team.

## Documentation

You can find vmss docs here: https://github.com/znanstvenikumeni/vmss/wiki

## What's this branch?

vmss is being completely rewritten in 2020, as we want it to be more usable, scalable and maintainable.
This branch servers for development until we reach feature parity with master (v0.2).

## Getting involved

We'd like to have you on board. As this is very-much-prerelease, we don't have many docs, but please feel free to send us an email or open an issue and we'll give you a tour/answer any of your questions.

The code in this branch should be readable, but we use some terms interchangeably throughout the code - which we'll fix before shipping.
