# Security Policy

VMSS is a crucial part of the infrastructure for Znanstvenik u meni!, so we're especially careful regarding its security.


## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you happen to find a security vulnerability, here's what you can do.

* Please, gather as much data about it as you can. This helps us fix it as soon as possible.
* If the vulnerability is not severe, feel free to open up an issue here. We consider every vulnerability with data leaks, data injection, remote code execution or similar to be high severity.
* If the vulnerability is severe, please don't report it here! You can e-mail us (me) at mbm@educateam.hr and we can discuss it privately. If you wish to discuss it over PGP-encrypted email or a different platform, we can make that happen as well.

When we get a vulnerability report, we'll do our best to respond to it as soon as possible. Depending on our obligations and abilities, we'll push a fix as fast as we can, but we can't promise an instant fix.

Thank you for making the Internet a better place.
